        About Feed Cambodia
      </h3>
      <p>
        Feed Cambodia is a brand new start-up charity organization founded by
        <a href="#/chanthu">Chanthu Oeur</a>. Our goal is to provide assistance
        to poverty-stricken people in Cambodia that are lacking life's essentials such as food, medicine,
        clothing, and shelter. We maximize the money going to those in need by
        keeping our overhead to a minimum. We do this by maintaining a small number of paid staff
        members and leveraging technology.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Aware, Care, Share
      </h4>
      <p>
        Our goal of providing assistance to Cambodians in need is achieved by three steps.
        Aware, Care, and Share:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aware:</strong> Through the use of low-cost social media marketing and other web-based
        technology, we hope to foster awareness about the plight of many Cambodians that are in desperate
        need of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Care:</strong> Once we have reached out to individuals and they are aware of the
        situation in Cambodia, we hope they will care and went to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Share:</strong> Those that care about what is going on in Cambodia may want to share.
        They can share their time by volunteering or helping us spread the word through social media
        channels. Or they can share their wealth by making a donation.
