        Yoeut is our liaison in Cambodia responsible for aid purchasing and distribution. Under the Khmer Rouge regime he was
        forced into hard labor building a dam. After that, while struggling to make a living at the Thai Cambodian border, he
        stepped on a land mine. He did not lose any limbs, but sustained life-threatening injuries to his torso. He still has
        shrapnel in his body to this day. Because he left the Thai refugee camp to find work, he and his family were unable to
        obtain sponsorship to the USA. In 1990 he was able to move back to his hometown in Cambodia and resume his livelihood
        as a rice farmer.
